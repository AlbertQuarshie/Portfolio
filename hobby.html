    <h1>Hobbies and Interests</h1>
    <p>
      These are the hobbies and interests that Bill Gates seems to enjoy most
    </p>

      This is the project that changed the world. By creating a standardized
      operating system that could run on almost any computer hardware, Gates
      effectively "democratized" computing. It moved technology out of massive
      server rooms and onto every desk, turning Microsoft into a global
      powerhouse and making Gates the world's youngest billionaire at the time.

    <h2>
      <strong><u>Reading</u></strong>
    </h2>

      Gates famously reads roughly 50 books a year (about one per week) and
      always travels with a tote bag full of them. He shares his top picks twice
      a year on his blog, Gates Notes, often highlighting titles on science,
      history, and global development.
