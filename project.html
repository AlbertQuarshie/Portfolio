    <h1>This are the Projects that Bill Gates has partaken in</h1>
    <h2>
      <strong><u>The Windows Operating System (Microsoft) </u></strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
        This is the project that changed the world. By creating a standardized
        operating system that could run on almost any computer hardware, Gates
        effectively "democratized" computing. It moved technology out of massive
        server rooms and onto every desk, turning Microsoft into a global
        powerhouse and making Gates the world's youngest billionaire at the
        time.

    <h2>
      <strong><u>Polio Eradication (The Gates Foundation)</u></strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Through the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, Gates has made it his
      personal mission to wipe polio off the map. Since the foundation began its
      work, cases have plummeted by over 99%. It is one of the most ambitious
      public health projects in history, nearing a status achieved only once
      before with smallpox: total global extinction of a disease.

    <h2>
      <strong><u>The Natrium Nuclear Reactor (TerraPower) </u></strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Gates's "moonshot" for the climate crisis is TerraPower. Unlike
      traditional nuclear plants, the Natrium reactor uses liquid sodium instead
      of water for cooling, which is safer and more efficient. He is currently
      building the first-of-its-kind demonstration plant in Wyoming, intending
      to provide a carbon-free, "always-on" energy source to replace coal
      plants.
