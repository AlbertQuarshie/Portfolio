      Bill Gates' education began at the private Lakeside School in Seattle,
      where he was enrolled at age 13. This period was pivotal as the school's
      Mothers' Club used rummage sale proceeds to buy a Teletype terminal,
      providing Gates with rare early access to a computer. He immediately
      showed an obsession with the machine, writing his first program—a
      tic-tac-toe game—and eventually co-founding the "Lakeside Programmers
      Group" to find software bugs for local companies in exchange for computer
      time. By his senior year, he and his friend Paul Allen were hired to write
      a class scheduling system for the school.

      <strong><u>Harvard University: 1973 - 1975</u></strong>

      In 1973, Gates enrolled at Harvard University after scoring a near-perfect
      1590 on his SAT. Although he initially intended to pursue a career in law
      to follow in his father's footsteps, he spent most of his time in the
      computer lab taking graduate-level mathematics and computer science
      courses. One of his most notable academic feats was solving the "pancake
      sorting" problem—a complex mathematical puzzle—in record time; his
      published solution remained the world's fastest for nearly 30 years.
      However, the release of the MITS Altair 8800 in 1975 prompted him to take
      a leave of absence to co-found Microsoft, and he permanently dropped out
      in his junior year. Harvard eventually awarded him an honorary doctorate
      in 2007.
