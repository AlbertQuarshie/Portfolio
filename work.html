      <strong><u>Co Founder and CEO of Microsoft: 1975 - 2000</u></strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Bill Gates is the co-founder of Microsoft Corporation, which he started in
      1975 along with Paul Allen. As a founder, he played a key role in
      developing the company’s vision of putting a computer on every desk and in
      every home. His technical expertise and business strategy helped Microsoft
      become one of the world’s leading technology companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gates served as Microsoft’s first Chief Executive Officer (CEO). During
      his time as CEO, he led the company’s growth, especially through the
      success of products like MS-DOS and the Windows operating system. Under
      his leadership, Microsoft became a dominant force in the personal computer
      industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2000, Bill Gates stepped down as CEO and handed over the position to
      Steve Ballmer. Although he remained involved with Microsoft for several
      years in different roles, he gradually shifted his focus toward
      philanthropy through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Today, he is no
      longer the CEO but is widely recognized as Microsoft’s co-founder and
      former leader.
